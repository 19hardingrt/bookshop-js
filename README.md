# bookshop-go

A simple book store API in need of input validation/sanitization.

This is a part of the University of Wyoming's Secure Software Design Course (Spring 2023). This is the base repository to be forked and updated for various assignments. Alternative language versions are available in:

- [Go](https://github.com/andey-robins/bookshop-go)
- [Rust](https://github.com/andey-robins/bookshop-rs)

## Versioning

`bookshop-js` is built with:

- node version v16.19.0
- npm version 9.6.2
- nvm version 0.39.3

## Usage

Start the api using `npm run dev`

I recommend using [`httpie`](https://httpie.io) for testing of HTTP endpoints on the terminal. Tutorials are available elsewhere online, and you're free to use whatever tools you deem appropriate for testing your code.
